## Libft
The libft is the first school project available. It is entirely in C. Our school policy doesn't allow us to use too many lib C functions, but rather recoding them ourselves. This way we learn code basics and rigor. Half of the functions are not from the lib C but could and are nevertheless as interesting to code.

## Install
Simply run
```
$ make
```

## Usage
The libft is library, you can include it in your projects writing ` #include "libft.h" `
